## 🧮 Project on Calculator Application using Method Overloading

A simple Calculator Application written in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication**, and Division.  
This project demonstrates the use of Java OOP concepts like Method Overloading, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, along with control structures and user input handling using the `Scanner` class.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- 🔁 Method Overloading for different parameter types:
  - Add two integers
  - Add two doubles
  - Add three integers
- ⚠️ Handles division by zero with proper exception handling
- 🧭 Interactive menu-driven interface
- 🧱 Clear, modular code structure — great for learning core OOP concepts in Java

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language : Java  
- IDE : VS Code

## 📚 Concepts Used

- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ✅ Method Overloading (compile-time Polymorphism)
- ✅ Exception Handling (`try-catch`)
- ✅ Control Structures (Loops, `switch-case`)
- ✅ Scanner for reading user input
